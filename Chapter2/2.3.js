/* Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.  */

let size = 8
let board = ""
for (rows=0; rows<size; rows++) {
  for (cols = 0; cols < size; cols++) {
    if ((rows + cols) % 2 == 0) {
      board = board + "#"; }
    else {
      board = board + " "; }
    }

  board = board + "\n" ;
}
console.log (board)
/* I cheated and used the hint here. I would've never thought of the row and column sum even/odd test carrying across all rows to make the staggered checker pattern. I need to be more observant/mindful of this kind of shit. */
